The Neolanders have developed a standardized snapper system based on the idea of widespread compatibility for all sorts of items within [Resonite.](https://www.resonite.com) Importantly, the items that operate within this framework are kept at default global scale and oriented so that "forward" (if applicable) is along the positive Z-axis.
## RingThing

RingThing snaptargets are commonly found in or on eyes, antennae tips, and item holsters.
