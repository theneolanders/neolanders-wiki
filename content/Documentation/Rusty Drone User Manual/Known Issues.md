[[- User Manual Info -]]

- Default suit size is too small
- New busters are positioned wrong in suit mode
- Non-trusted pilots can't open their own chest compartment
- The chest compartment can't be opened while shutdown, preventing the power core from being reinserted in case of energy loss
- Leg raycasts don't account for user scale
- Headguns tilt incorrectly if the drone's head is not facing the same direction as the body
- Deploying the minigun too quickly after closing it causes it to have too many barrels
- The minigun sound driving doesnâ€™t spool down correctly when retracting
- Bitbot doesn't disappear quickly enough during rocket/bike/compact mode transformations
- Dequipping suit mode doesn't reset hands

#### Sequence breaks
- Turret mode doesn't mesh well with rocket/bike mode
- Many features fail to deactivate on shutdown
- Switching to bike mode directly from rocket mode while the minigun is deployed will not retract it
