(For the group's history, see [the info page on The Neolanders' website](https://www.theneolanders.com/info/))

When you really boil it down, The Neolanders are a group of friends who share the urge to make. Programming, modeling, texture art, writing, drawing, and so much more. Each member fits in because they want to show their perspective to the world.
