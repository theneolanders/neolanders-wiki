>The Neolanders are a real group of people, not to be confused with [[The Ringleaders]], the fictional alliance between the characters made by Neolanders

The Neolanders are a group of friends who share the urge to make. Programming, modeling, texture art, writing, drawing, and so much more. Each member fits in because they want to show their perspective to the world. The team has collaborated on [[Group Portfolio|multiple creative projects]] over the years.

### History
They began as a group of players moving to NeosVR from Anyland in 2021 as its development had been stagnating, but quickly picked up like-minded individuals from the NeosVR community. The name Neolanders was chosen both for the combination of NeosVR and Anylanders, as well as the double meaning of "New Landers", since they had travelled to new virtual worlds in pursuit of a better place to express themselves.
The double meaning continued to be useful as The Neolanders, along with the rest of the NeosVR community, were forced to move once again to Resonite. With a shrinking proportion of the team originating from Anyland, and the group no longer associating with NeosVR, the secondary meaning of the group name took priority.
