**Jackson 'Jack' Jensen**, known as the [[Shogun]] to the ranks of [[Tavish Augmetitech]], is the right-hand-man of [[Lena]]. Born January 3rd, 2635 on the planet [[Thanatos IV]], he was positioned by his parents- both working for Tavish- to succeed them as an accountant. But this was not meant to be, and years of suffering hardened him into a trained killer for the corporation's interests.
