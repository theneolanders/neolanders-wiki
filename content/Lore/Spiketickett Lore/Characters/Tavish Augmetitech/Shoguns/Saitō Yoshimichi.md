**Saitō Yoshimichi**(斎藤 善道), the first [[Shōgun]] of [[Tavish Augmetitech]], was born in 1546 during the middle of the Sengoku 'Warring States' period in feudal Japan. He would go on to serve the Oda clan as a samurai shortly before the surprise attack by the Imagawa clan was repelled. He would then join the march to the capital of Kyoto with the rest of the Oda clan and aid in the efforts of Japanese reunification. 

After the ritual suicide of his master, Nobunaga Oda, during attempts at reunification in 1582, he was deeply distraught. Rather than following the daimyo's example, he defied bushidō and decided to continue living. Fleeing the country on a Portuguese merchant ship, he became a mercenary in their service, later travelling to Spain to perform the same work.

Later, he would go on to journey around the Americas with Spanish colonials, discover the true Fountain of Youth in Spanish territory and have a curse befall him upon drinking from its sacred waters- he would be forced to wander forever, from conflict to conflict- until there were no battles left to fight.

The first time he came across [[Leena Tuonen]] was in the early 2000's, while chasing down a Hong Kong triad group who were trafficking heroin into Germany. After what should have been a fatal run-in with the men he was searching for, he cut each of them down and then limped into the street, riddled with bullets from their Heckler and Koch submachine guns. As he collapsed, emergency medical services arrived on the scene and took him to the foremost hospital in the region.

Leena happened to be touring this hospital at the time as her insurance company was in talks with them, and passed by Yoshimichi's room. She was shocked to see a man in what seemed to be perfect health in the intensive care unit, and asked if she could pause the tour. Her request was granted, and she entered the room calmly, closing the door behind herself. Even at a distance, she could sense this man's vitality was boundless.

Their gazes met, an icy look to a blazing one. No words needed to be exchanged for Yoshimichi to understand why this woman had paid him any mind when no one else would. His eyes welled up as he began to beg. "Please kill me, Izanami! Kill me, please!" Leena walked to his bedside and placed a finger to her lips, extinguishing his cries. "Not so loud-- I haven't come here for you. That isn't my name, either." "Then who are you here for?" he whispered. "No particular person. Just doing business."

"Business... That's what I was taking care of too before I ended up here." Yoshimichi pushed his heated blanket down to reveal the fresh bandages around his torso, and began tearing at them. "Sir! You need those to heal!" Leena reached to stop him, but the moment her hand neared him, he grabbed it in a flash with one arm, continuing to rip the bandages with the other. She refrained from continuing to protest.

Once his injuries were exposed, Leena gasped in bewilderment. Rather than open wounds as she had expected, these scars looked as if they were dents in steel. A nurse slid the door open, rushing to the bedside opposite Leena. Her nose turned up at the sight of the aged man. "Again? I've already had to redress your bandages once today!" She set off to wrapping him with new gauze exactly as before.
