**Jackson 'Jack' Jensen**, known as the [[Shogun]] to the ranks of [[Tavish Augmetitech]], is the current right-hand-man of [[Leena Tuonen]]. Born on the planet [[Thanatos IV]], he was positioned by his parents- both working for Tavish- to succeed them as an accountant. But this was not meant to be, and instead years of suffering hardened him into a trained killer for the corporation's interests.
## Biography

#### Origins
Jackson Jensen was born January 3rd, 2635 on Thanatos IV to two Tavish Augmetitech employees. Growing up, he was placed in Tavish's own complimentary educational programs rather than going to a typical school. This was meant to place him down the path to work in a similar line of work. His education focused almost exclusively on STEM topics, with special attention paid to science and math. It was believed this would make the most productive workers for the Tavish corporation- however, in Jackson's case, it was a failure. 

He retained what he learned, of course, but failed to apply it when it came time for his internship as an accountant. His work performance languished as he failed to meet deadlines, struggled in making it to work on time, and required assistance from his coworkers. These together fueled his superiors' resentment for him- and his only saving grace was nepotism. His family ties were all that saved him from being sacked. And so, this state of affairs continued for a while until his supervisors had enough.

Rather than going through typical channels to handle this, they decided an example needed to be made out of Jensen. If he could not offer anything to the company as an accountant, then he would instead offer his life as a lab rat. At first, this was just played off as pranks around the office. But rapidly, it would become more of a hazing ritual intended to humiliate him. All of this culminated into one final "prank" that would permanently alter Jack's life.

On June 5th, 2654, an unidentified Tavish employee slipped a cocktail of psychoactive chemicals into Jackson's morning coffee. An hour later, as he was shuffling papers around on his desk, the drugs struck him like a freight train. His hands trembled as his heart throbbed out of his chest, beating from his head to his toes. Spiders crawled from below his worksheets, their silhouettes throbbing in time with his heart. He heard his coworkers wail out strings of unintelligible words, and he ran to their cubicles, only to realize they were all empty. 

Looking out the window, Jackson saw [[Cal Seaamm]] in the reflection behind him, his spindly, bony figure watching from afar. Jack turned to search for the figure, but only dead air surrounded his gaze. He returned to the window, but the environment was blanketed in shadow when it had just been... morning? Noon? Sunset? All sense of time melted away as he continued to stare. The walls began to shift and close in on him, and the ceiling lights went out wherever he walked.

Finally, a door exposed itself in Jack's view- an exit from the cubicle farm. The walls began to melt away, giving way to the outdoors. The amethyst foliage was standard fare for Thanatos, of course, but it was shifting, shambling towards Jack. He took off running, the many shadowy spiders from before following close behind. The spiders crawled on one another, their silhouettes melding together, forming again into the gaunt Cal Seaamm. He gave chase to Jackson, his bones clacking with each step.

Time continued to speed up, hours turning to mere minutes. Clouds flew by overhead and the sun set over the mountains once again already. Stumbling, trembling, throbbing, Jack found a Tavish-branded VTOL- which had just landed, and jammed both arms into its turbofan. Red mist spilled out of the fan and he collapsed to the ground. He had believed this would set him free from this 72-hour hell. But unbeknownst to him, this would only push him deeper into a new one.
