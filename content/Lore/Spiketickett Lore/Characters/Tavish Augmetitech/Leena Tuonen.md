**Leena Tuonen** is the current chairwoman, CEO, and founder of [[Tavish Augmetitech]]. She has retained each of these positions for 616 years, from its founding on Earth in 2046, to the current day in 2662. Little is known to the public about Leena besides her previous career, that being of an insurance mogul with multiple executive positions at health and life insurance companies. The philosophy that drives her decisions within the company is often speculated upon; although she claims the company is only focused on human longevity and well-being, some believe her motive runs deeper than profit.
