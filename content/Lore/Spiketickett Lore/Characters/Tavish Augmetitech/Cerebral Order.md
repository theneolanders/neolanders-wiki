**The Cerebral Order** is a committee that serves as [[Tavish Augmetitech]]'s advisory board. Unlike a board of directors, they are not beholden to the company's shareholders; rather, they are elected by, and answer directly to, [[Leena Tuonen]]. They both handle Tavish's day-to-day tasks and advise the founder in specific areas. There are always eight members at a time, each color coded to suit their unique discipline. Another commonality in each member's appearance is that they all have clear [[Braincase|braincases]].
