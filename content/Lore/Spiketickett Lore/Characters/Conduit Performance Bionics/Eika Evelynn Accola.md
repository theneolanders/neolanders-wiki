**Eika Evelynn Accola** is the 27th in line to take up her family's business [[Conduit Performance Bionics]], starting with [[Leonard Accola]] all the way back in 1948. Her approach to management is very hands-off, instead acting more as a figurehead rather than being involved in every facet of the company.
