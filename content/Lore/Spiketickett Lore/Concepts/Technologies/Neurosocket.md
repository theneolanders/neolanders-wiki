A **neurosocket** is an [[Implants and augmentations|implant]] which serves as an external interface with the central nervous system.
These standardized ports can be placed anywhere on the body, although the most efficient ones are placed directly along the spinal column- or even fused into the skull.

Primary uses include, but are not limited to:

- Power delivery
- Data transfer
- Prosthesis/Bionic coupling

When used in concert with a [[Neural Lace|neural lace]], which serves as the internal connection with the central nervous system, the brain can then freely communicate with machines, implants, and computers.
