The ‘Spinal Tap’ is a popular procedure offered by [[Tavish Augmetitech]] in which the groundwork is laid for multiple [[Neurosocket|neurosockets]] to be [[Implants and augmentations|implanted]] along the vertebral column for easy access, while also making improvements to the central nervous system.
Two packages are offered; an economy package and a premium package.
#### Economy Package - Retain Organic Matter
Holes are drilled through each vertebrae.
Synthetic nervecable bundles are threaded through the holes.
Junctions to the nervecables are spliced into the spinal ganglia.
These junctions translate between fiber-optic signals and nerve impulses respectively.

Up to 5 neurosockets are placed along the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine, from vertebrae C6 and C7, vertebrae T1-12, to vertebrae L1 and L2.
