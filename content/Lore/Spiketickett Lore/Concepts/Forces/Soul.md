In [[The Secondary Timeline|the secondary timeline]], the concept of the soul is not of the ethereal, but rather a physical phenomenon that can be measured. It is a result of life's humble beginnings, being seeded across the stars in a panspermia event. In the inky void of space, single-celled organisms developed organelles that allowed them to pull energy directly from [[Underspace]] to subsist off of. Although these organelles slowly became obsolescent as multi-cellular life developed, they never truly disappeared. This small influence allowed minor differences to the primary timeline's life to form, the most significant being that consciousness is inherently hyper-inefficient. This one change resulted in artificial intelligence being infeasible without a near-infinite power source.
