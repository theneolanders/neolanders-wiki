Zenitaf (Zeen-it-aff) was a planet in the primary timeline. Existing in the **[[Yuris]]** System, it was the only other planet in **[[The Primary Timeline]]** with documented sapient life. It was the home of the **[[Yurigans]]**.

Zenitaf was a small but extremely dense planet, having a high concentration of **[Cobalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt)** and other heavy metals, consequentially, the creatures that have evolved to live on the planet are unaffected by heavy metal poisoning.

The specific makeup of metals in the planet's crust gave some areas of the planet the properties of natural batteries, charged by static electricity and electrical storms. This, combined with the natural scientific curiosity of the **[[Yurigans]]**, led to a relatively quick understanding of the properties of electricity and how to utilize it.
