[[The Ringleaders]] is a fictional setting created by [[The Neolanders]]. The primary purpose of the narrative is to foster a creative environment where each member can write a representation of themselves into a cast of characters and explore the resulting interactions.

In late 2018, Rustybot ([[Neolander Information/Rustybot|the person]], not [[Lore/Rustybot Lore/Rustybot|the character]]) wrote a short story to give some fictional backstory for his visual design style. Since that document, dozens of others have contributed ideas, characters, information, and scenes to that ever-expanding narrative world.

[[The Multiverse|The Ringleaders Multiverse]] is deliberately set up in such a way that a given [[The Multiverse#The Timelines|timeline]] can have any rules the author desires and still be compatible with the rest of the story. At its core, the multiverse is intended to allow any character from any setting to interact with each other in a meaningful way.
