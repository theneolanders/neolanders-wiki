[[The Ringleaders]] is a set of stories written by The Neolanders. The primary purpose of the narrative is to foster a creative environment where each member can write a representation of themselves into a cast of characters and explore the resulting interactions.

In late 2018, Rustybot (the person, not the character) wrote a short story to give some fictional backstory for his visual design style. Since that document, [[The Neolanders|dozens of others]] have contributed ideas, characters, information, and scenes to that ever-expanding narrative.

[[The Ringleaders|The Ringleaders Multiverse]] is deliberately set up in such a way that a given [[The Multiverse|timeline]] can have any rules the author desires and still be compatible with the rest of the story.
