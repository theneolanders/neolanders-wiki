The **Twisted Seraphim** is a criminal organization wholly focused on profiting from large-scale thefts. It is made up of five members: four are heavily augmented women from [[The Secondary Timeline|the secondary timeline]], and the fifth is [[Lumina]], their former leader, who is currently estranged from the group.
This shakeup was caused by her unwilling recruitment by [[Tavish Augmetitech]].

## Active Members
### Alcea
##### Personality
Alcea has a very fiery personality, appearing threatening and hostile to people, though this is just a facade she built up for the sake of getting business done.  She has a sweet side she basically never shows anyone cause it would kill their impression of her.
##### Appearance
Alcea has curly fire-engine red hair, with a black tiara atop her head. Beyond the tiara, her hair is tied into a large bun- giving the appearance of a full crown. Her hair also has a cowlick on each side of her head that look like horns. Her skin appears to be bronzed, and she has multiple tattoos. One of them is visible on her right arm- a snake wrapped around its length from her shoulder to her wrist. She wears a white sleeveless jumpsuit, with two belts around her hips. The jumpsuit exposes her back, revealing a much larger yakuza tattoo of a snake wrapped around a dagger with roses around it. She wears a skull necklace and a metal V-shaped choker.
