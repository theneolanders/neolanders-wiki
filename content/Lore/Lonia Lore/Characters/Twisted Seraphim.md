The **Twisted Seraphim** is a criminal organization wholly focused on profiting from large-scale thefts. It is made up of five members: four are heavily augmented women from [[The Secondary Timeline|the secondary timeline]], and the fifth is [[Lumina]], their former leader, who is currently estranged from the group.
This shakeup was caused by her unwilling recruitment by [[Tavish Augmetitech]].

## Active Members
### Alcea

The former leader of the group before Lumina was taken in. After Lumina's departure, she returned to that position.
##### Personality
Highly ambitious, she aims to dominate every situation she finds herself in. Although she appears apathetic on the surface, she is highly motivated by aggression, materialism, and megalomania. She believes that she must always come first, even to the detriment of her own gang. 
##### Appearance
Alcea has curly fire-engine red hair, with a black tiara atop her head. Beyond the tiara, her hair is tied into a large bun- giving the appearance of a full crown. Her hair also has a cowlick on each side of her head that look like horns. Her eyes' irises are gold with spirals imprinted onto them, and their sclera are black. Her skin appears to be bronzed, and she has multiple tattoos. One of them is visible on her left arm- a snake wrapped around its length from her shoulder to her wrist. She wears a white bell-bottomed jumpsuit with no sleeves, with slits placed near the calves for flexibility, and two belts around her hips. The jumpsuit exposes her back, revealing a much larger yakuza-style tattoo of a snake wrapped around a dagger with roses around it. She wears a skull necklace and a metal V-shaped choker. She wears silver high-heels with two straps and ruby soles. Her hands have been extensively modified- with metal claws and protective jewelry implanted directly into them. She also wears many of the stolen rings she has collected.
##### Powers
As the only true [[Psionics|psionic]] of the group, she has the ability to manipulate the blood within people's bodies, including her own. Because of this ability, she rarely uses weapons, instead resorting to melee when necessary.
### Leia
##### Powers
Uses implants originally intended for construction workers, now repurposed for their absurd toughness. Her left arm can transform into multiple different tools, but the one she uses most commonly is a massive spiral drill for hard surfaces.
### Lily
##### Powers
Uses her expertise to create explosives and chemical weapons used in the gang's schemes. Her body has been modified to be immune to the toxins she uses in her weaponry- to the point that she breathes toxic gas through her rebreather instead of air. 
### Violet 
##### Powers
Often operating from a distance, she uses her skills to infiltrate the networks of her targets and make things simpler for the gang. When she is operating in the field, she has a variety of tools at her disposal contained within the bracers on her arms. The main ones of note are holographic projectors for displaying digital information, tools to break into systems, and cables for connecting to them.
