#### Personality
Lumina is a risk taker, often gambling with her life for the possibility of reward. In conversation, she is highly talkative and will often make witty remarks at others' expense. She has a hard time staying still, always requiring physical or mental stimulation to keep herself engaged.

After being cured of her transformation into [[Caligo]], her demeanor rapidly shifted overnight. She closed herself off from everything, vowing to never allow herself to be hurt again. This especially manifested as a compulsion to be insulated from the outside world, believing that covering herself up fully was the only way to be safe. Now plagued by anxiety, her extroversion and risk taking behaviors are now a thing of the past.

#### Appearances
WIP


#### Abilities
As the chosen avatar of Ninko, Lumina has been bestowed Ninko's unique dominion over visible light. Clever usage of this power enables her to perform many feats that may not be immediately obvious. This includes, but is not limited to:  
- Flight and super speed
- Illusions and invisibility
- Conjuring objects from hard light
- Light-based attacks (lasers, flashes, slashes, and waves)
