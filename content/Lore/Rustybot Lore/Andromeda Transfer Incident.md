After the successful return signals of the intergalactic probes sent to Andromeda, [[Rustybot|Toby Tsur]] confined his consciousness to a [[Drones|Rusty Drone]] and transport himself to the distant star system of [[Quindol]] using [[Faster Than Light Technology|Induced Quantum Tunneling]] as both a publicity stunt and proof of concept for intergalactic travel.

If all went according to plan, Toby would make planetfall in the drone while a new launch window opened so that Earth would be able to send additional parts to him. He would then begin building the infrastructure for an IQT Anchor travel hub.

Unfortunately, the activation protocol did not proceed. Rather than booting once in orbit, Toby was locked into a state of total sensory deprivation for 3.39726 years of subjective time.

The trauma experienced by Toby in this event is thought to be the most important factor behind his subsequent personality shift, and the cause of The Rusty Exodus.

## The Rusty Exodus

The Rusty Exodus is a period of roughly 16 hours in February of 2171 immediately following [[Rustybot]]'s awakening where he decommissioned all [[Rusty Manufacturing]] assets in the Sol system before cutting communications with Earth entirely.

Due to earth's reliance on Rusty Manufacturing for raw materials and the upkeep of the [[The Datanet]], the exodus caused near-total societal collapse on an unprecedented scale.
