## Previously Known As Toby Tsur

Born as a biological human in the year 2135, Toby Tsur was the son of [[Rodney Tsur]] and [[Melody Tsur]]. He was fascinated with space travel, robotics, and automation from a very young age. This lead him to become increasingly cybernetic until the age of 25, when he underwent a final procedure to become fully robotic.

At the age of 29, Toby would found the company [[Rusty Manufacturing]].

Toby would eventually take on his chosen name, [[Rustybot]], following the [[Andromeda Transfer Incident]].
