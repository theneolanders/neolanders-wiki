Each timeline in [[The Multiverse]] is equally as real as any other, making a designation such as "primary" somewhat of a misnomer. The Primary Timeline is narratively defined by [[Rustybot]] and [[The Swarm]] as their universe of origin for the sake of subjectively cataloguing the multiverse. It is also sometimes referred to as The Primeline.

This Primary Timeline is unique in that it has a non-permeable [[The Multiverse#Universal Membranes|lower membrane]], meaning there is no natural influence from [[The Multiverse#Underspace|Underspace]]. Practically speaking, the only forces present are the baseline physical laws which every universe has. The Primeline therefore is no different from [[Lore Information|our own universe]] until the year 2135, when [[Rustybot#Previously Known As Toby Tsur|Toby Tsur]] is born and it [[The Multiverse#Divergence|diverges]].
