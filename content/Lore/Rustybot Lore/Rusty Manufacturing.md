Founded by [[Lore/Rustybot Lore/Rustybot#Previously Known As Toby Tsur|Toby Tsur]] in the year 2164, Rusty Manufacturing is a corporation from Earth.

Prior to [[Andromeda Transfer Incident#The Rusty Exodus|The Rusty Exodus]], Rusty Manufacturing focused on the advancement of spaceborn automation. The company was most notable for adopting [[Faster Than Light Technology|Quantum Entangled Communication]] technology in 2168, just two years after it was developed. This adoption led to the creation of [[Rusty Manufacturing#The Datanet|The Datanet]].

## Notable Technology

### Drones
A Drone is any Rusty Manufacturing unit capable of being controlled by a [[Rusty Manufacturing#Pilots|Pilot]]. Drones range from Bitbots to Alpha Drones and can have a wide variety of functionality, but are primarily used for the automation of manual labor.

#### Alpha Drones
Alpha Drones are equipped with multiple [[The Multiverse#Underspace|Underspace]] Harvester Cores, Microfabricators, and countless weapon systems. These drones are capable of self repair and indefinite uptime. Pilots in these units usually lead exploration missions and expansion initiatives.

> [!NOTE] The Prime Unit
> While a Prime Unit is often referred to as a separate type of drone, this distinction is only a form of utility to denote which Alpha Drone is currently being inhabited by [[Lore/Rustybot Lore/Rustybot]]. There's no physical change in the structure of the drone.

#### Beta Drones
Beta Drones are often assigned to an individual production facility. They have limited combat capabilities but extensive sensor suites.

#### Gamma Drones
Gamma Drones are universal manual labor machines. Not much more than a hull and motors. Often a few dozen exist under each Beta.

#### Bitbots
Bitbots are a subset of Rusty Drone that consist of a hover thruster, display screen, and interaction beam array. They often act as autonomous power tools or surveillance units. The primary purpose of a Bitbot is to perform autonomous maintenance, especially in small or otherwise hard to reach places. Unlike the majority of Rusty Manufacturing robotics, Bitbots are true A.I., meaning they are synthetic neural networks and not a copy of an uploaded human mind.
### Dataspace
Dataspace (not to be confused with [[Rusty Manufacturing#The Datanet|The Datanet]]), is a digital representation of Rusty Manufacturing's systems. Rather than being a single simulated environment, Dataspace is the culmination of RM's computational power. Every server hub, research facility, production complex, and drone is directly connected via [[Faster Than Light Technology#Quantum Entangled Communication|QEC]] circuitry. The result is a web of information and calculations flowing to and from every piece of equipment the company produces simultaneously.

In a certain sense, Dataspace can be thought of as the brain behind the company, forming [[Rusty Manufacturing|Rusty Prime]].
### Underspace Harvester Cores
haha infinite energy go brrrr
### Pilots
A Rusty Pilot is an individual consciousness created by duplicating [[Lore/Rustybot Lore/Rustybot]]'s personality composition. Their motivations are tweaked such that they will find maximum fulfillment by performing their designated task to perfection, thus ensuring maximum efficiency of all workers.

### The Datanet
An early version of Dataspace, The Datanet is a now-defunct extension of the internet using breakthrough [[Faster Than Light Technology]]. 

Rusty Manufacturing developed the Datanet for the betterment of humanity, and user's enjoyed open access to it's services for no cost. This led to mass adoption of the system, to the point of nearly two thirds of earth's information traffic being routed through RM servers.

As a result of the [[Andromeda Transfer Incident]], the Datanet would be shut down, causing mass collapse of digital infrastructure known as [[Andromeda Transfer Incident#The Rusty Exodus|The Rusty Exodus]].
