The Quindol System is a star system in the Andromeda Galaxy that was discovered in the year (something like 2172 maybe), and projected to have a similar layout to the Sol system. Using [[Faster Than Light Technology]] invented by [[Rustybot]], various probes were sent to chart the system and its bodies.

## Notable Features

#### Quindol
A blue giant star at the center of the system. 

#### Quindune
The closest planet to the star, Qindune is still more than 8 AU away.

#### Quindlet
In the goldilocks zone of the system, Quindlet is one of the rare few exoplanets in [[The Primary Timeline]] to harbor life.

#### Quindring
Named after its massive rings, this planet has nearly twice the mass of Jupiter and rings just over five times the radius of Saturn's.

#### Quindistant
This rocky body orbits nearly a full light hour past Quindring's orbit and has an abnormally high heavy metal content for its outer-system position.
#### Asteroid Belts

##### Belt A
This belt lies between Quindlet and Quindring. It has roughly four times the mass of the Sol system's internal asteroid belt.
##### Belt B
This belt surrounds the system just beyond the outermost planet and can be compared to the [Kuiper Belt.](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/kuiper-belt/)
##### Belt C
The outermost is closer to a cloud of debris than an actual belt, and can be compared to the [Oort Cloud.](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/oort-cloud/facts/)
