Animium is a deep red metal, it's extremely rough, rigid, and difficult to manipulate precisely, it originates in [[Timeline 2-B]]. 

This metal was discovered by [[Sarah Kelly]], and used to prosper her ventures to success.

### Functions

This metal can act almost as it's own [[Underspace]] generator, but it needs a secondary source of energy to pull from first. Rather it be a traditional harvester from [[The Primary Timeline]], or a soul tuned into [[Psionics]] in the [[The Secondary Timeline]], it must be a source pulling from Underspace. This metal will naturally of it's own accord use that source as a gateway to pull extra energy into itself.

#### Energy formations

###### Natural
The origin of the metal can vary location to location, most naturally found animium will convert gathered Underspace power into a form of heat surrounding the metal, allowing for energy collection through the power of heat.

###### Unnatural
Animium that is heavily altered can be unstable, melting, exploding, cracking into bits, it's unstable, however if done correctly one can manipulate the material to produce straight electricity instead of heat which allows for not a single bit of energy loss like collecting heat would produce.
When you charge animium with a large amount of electricity, it becomes even more unstable than altered or fabricated animium, tending to explode in abnormally large volumes compared to the amount of animium charged up. This makes perfectly altered animium still a major risk, as if the energy isn't used from it at all times being charged, it could explode easily.
### Looping energy

Discovered by Sarah, in a very precise formation a large group of animium can start pulling energy from themselves as long as there's a form of harvester to jumpstart the structure, and within a similar ruleset of The Secondary Timeline, all she needed was herself to jumpstart everything.

This creates close to near infinite energy source, the only limit being that this animium generator requires a bare minimum amount of energy to continue generating any. This method can only exist using unnatural animium, usually that of the fabricated kind as the formations needed in the metal are too precise to easily get with altered animium.
