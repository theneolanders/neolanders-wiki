This was a set of experimentations set by the founder of [[Mantra Innovators]], [[Samuel Kurt]].
Due to a highly adapted strand of his first ever experiment [[E.N.E.R.G.I]], in a way, he had an uncureable sickness that had plauged him for many years, and these experiments were just at the end of his ropes.

The end result, eventually through many different hoops, was [[Unit 19]], however there 18 other experimentations, the only ones really of any worth being [[Unit 1]], and [[Unit 8]].
