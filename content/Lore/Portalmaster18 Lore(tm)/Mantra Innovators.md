Founder and CEO: [[Samuel Kurt]]
This company was founded offically after it's founder figured out the discovery of a, at the time, revolutionary resource he labeled [[E.N.E.R.G.I]]. The money from that project alone granted him from some nobody working in a basement, to working on large projects to get the people of [[Beynos]] out back into space.

[[Samuel Kurt]]'s discoveries lead to all sorts of things, but one of the most important ones right after the discovery of [[E.N.E.R.G.I]], was what happened when he finally managed to breach Beynos' atmosphere, that of which is for now labeled as [[The Splinter Event]].
