"It... Worked."

I stare breathlessly at the foam cube we use for testing for a solid few seconds before I remember Iâ€™m still recording.

"Uh, Induced Quantum Tunneling development log, entry 3578. Result of experiment: Success. Complete success. The contents of the booth were instantaneously transported from station A to station B with no complications. Distance: Four centimeters. Date point: Two Forty Three, July si-" I paused for a moment as today's significance sunk in. "...July sixth, 2168. Happy birthday to me I suppose. End log entry 3578."

I signed out of the program, shut down the device, and slouched back into my chair. Doing a quick mental check of the lab's security systems through my internal Datanet connection, I find myself alone for the night. Classic. It's 2AM and I crack FTL travel while there's no one around to celebrate with.

I chuckle to myself at the absurdity of the situation while cleaning up the workspace. A little under four years ago we didn't know if it was even possible to communicate faster than light. Then I get transferred to streamlining high-density communications traffic using quantum entangling, and now I'm head of the FTL research department.

Tomorrow - er, later today - I'll get these results verified, and after that we can move on to phase two. Hopefully by then the reality of the situation will have sunk in. There's no way I should be this calm after a breakthrough like what just happened.
