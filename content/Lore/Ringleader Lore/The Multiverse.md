The story of [[The Ringleaders]] takes place within The Multiverse. Each timeline represents a path history might have taken. Following the logic that "everything that can happen, will happen", the Ringleaders' multiverse has at least one universe for every possible event.

More literally, The Multiverse is composed of Underspace, Overspace, and The Timelines.

## Underspace

Underspace is a zero-dimensional point of infinite energy that forms the foundation of The Multiverse. It is separated from three dimensional spacetime by what is known as the Lower Membrane.

As a universe ages, it pulls energy from Underspace to fuel its expansion. In most cases, the lower membrane is permeable enough to allow energy to flow "up" from Underspace and affect the base properties of that universe. This influence is the cause of [[The Multiverse#Physical Laws|non-standard physics]].

---
## Overspace

Overspace is a fifth dimensional filament that houses every possible timeline within it. Paradoxically, it is defined as being a place where existence itself cannot occur. A universe is then defined as an exemption from this rule where existence *can* occur. Anything not contained by an [[The Multiverse#Universal Membranes|upper membrane]] counts as Overspace, though the term "outside" is slightly misleading when assigned to a concept beyond spacetime.

## The Timelines

A Timeline (A.K.A. a universe) is a fourth dimensional object within which all forms of comprehendible existence take place. They are composed of a lower membrane, upper membrane, and one or more interiors.

The interior of a universe is where all physical existence takes place. Three dimensional spacetime, matter, and physical forces all exist within this structure. Notably, a universe is not necessarily limited to a single interior. One of the more frequent examples of this phenomenon is the idea that a second version of the universe exists parallel to the inhabited one which can be used to travel from point to point [[Faster Than Light Technology|faster than light]]. This concept is often referred to as "subspace" in sci-fi terms, but can also be compared to something like [The Nether](https://minecraft.wiki/w/The_Nether), or even [The Quantum Realm](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Quantum_Realm).

In the case of many interiors a timeline may be depicted as a set of overlapping planes, such as in [The Forgotten Realms.](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Prime_Material_plane?file=Ethereal-map-2e.jpg) Timelines where this is the case can often be thought of as finite multiverses in their own right. They may have internal pantheons, planar travel, and "in-between" realms. It's important to note that these timelines are held together as one due to a shared upper and lower [[The Multiverse#Universal Membranes|membrane]].

## Universal Membranes

As varied as timelines can be, there are a few constants. Two of these constants are the upper and lower membranes. These conceptual barriers act as the dividing line between what "is" and what "isn't".
#### Upper
The upper membrane can be thought of as the more typical "edge of the universe". In most cases, it can not be reached in a spatial sense (that is, it isn't a *physical* edge) but rather is the representation of the limits of three dimensional existence.
#### Lower
The lower membrane is what separates a timeline from the infinite energy of Underspace. While Underspace itself is a single point, the lower membrane is spread across a universe in such a way that it allows the energy to flow in from any location (assuming sufficient permeability).
#### Permeability
How permeable each membrane is determines the behavior of the universe it encompasses. Under classical circumstances, neither membrane is at all permeable. This results in a universe that cannot be escaped from (as the upper membrane disallows egress) and has no magic, entropy reversal, or [[The Multiverse#True Magic|chaos force]] (as the lower membrane does not allow for the intake of energy).

## Physical Laws

Each timeline in the multiverse has a base set of laws that govern their behavior. These laws are the ones we, [[Lore Information|in real life]], are familiar with. They include but are not limited to the three fundamental forces and gravity.

Barring a few exceptions, any properties of a universe that fall outside the realm of proven science can be regarded as [[The Multiverse#Magic|magic]].

## Magic As Alternative Physics

When a character or setting uses a set of rules that is incongruent with typical physics, it is often referred to as magic. This is primarily because the story takes place from the perspective of [[The Primary Timeline]], where breaking the laws of physics is not possible without outside influence. It is important to note, however, that from the perspective of other universes these rules hold the same weight and power as "traditional" physics.

[[Psionics]] in [[The Secondary Timeline]] are an example of this phenomenon. The consciousness field has clear rules and parameters through which it can be interacted. Though these forces are not present in the Primeline, they are still able to be understood and analyzed. Thus, the difference between alternative physics and True Magic can be defined as whether or not internal consistency can be found.

---
## True Magic

Also known as Chaos Force, True Magic is the raw power of Underspace being harnessed to bring a task to its least logical conclusion. Or at least, its most *interesting* conclusion.

True Magic is what allows abilities such as toonforce or fourth wall breaks to be entirely diegetic. It is an acknowledgement that [[The Ringleaders]] exist in fiction and that the rules can be broken for the sake of entertainment.

Importantly, Chaos Force is not limited to timelines with arcane themes or permeable membranes. Despite being bound entirely by the laws of physics, [[Rustybot]] is technically a user of True Magic due to his development of [[Rusty Manufacturing#Underspace Harvester Cores|Underspace Harvester Cores]]. While they may not have the same trappings as other magical devices, they allow for more flexibility in creating interesting technology and for .

As such, the real purpose of True Magic is to foster interesting events and interactions.

## Divergence

Divergence is the process by which two timelines emerge from one after an impactful event. When a great new technology is discovered in one but not another, those timelines will drift apart. If a traveler from another universe makes contact, a new split will occur. 

In a manner of speaking, timelines can "overlap" in a sort of superposition if they are similar enough. In a different manner of speaking, timelines can be created when a random event or outside influence causes two outcomes to be equally likely.
