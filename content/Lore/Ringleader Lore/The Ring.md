The Ring is a space station built by [[Rustybot]] and [[The Swarm]] in the year 2199. It was built as a form of truce between the two after the events of [[First Contact]]. Cared for by [[The Ring Steward|The Steward]], The Ring is purposefully kept free of military and industrial equipment. It instead acts as a no-man's-land orbiting a star directly between The Milky Way and Andromeda where all parties involved can diplomatically interact.

## The Archive
[[The Ringleaders]] are no strangers to powerful artifacts or dangerous trinkets. The Archive is a non-Euclidian section of the space station brought into being by the magic of [[The Bardificer]]. Within, one can find a plethora of cursed objects and otherworldly doohickeys, safely catalogued and stored away.
